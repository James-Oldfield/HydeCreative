		<p>H by Hyde aims to showcase independent publications by new and 
		established creatives. From Art to Poetry we bring you works from across the globe all the way to our pop-up bookshop launching at the end of Summer 2015 in East London.</p>

		<p>The intention for the project is to bring together an eclectic mix of creativity and encourage interdisciplinary discourse between emerging artists, 
		designers and writers. To further this creative exchange, the bookshop will hold talks, workshops and mixers, engaging the reader with our brimming pool of talent.</p>

		<p>H by Hyde is the first major project launch by Hyde Creative agency. The aim of the agency is to foster collaboration across creative disciplines and 
		advance the interdisciplinary nature of the modern creative practice.</p>
